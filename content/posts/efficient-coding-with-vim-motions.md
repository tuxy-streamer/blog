When you hear vim is the best text editor, it isn't the performance or
the customizability of the editor. Most of the time it's about the vim motions.

## What are vim motions ?

Vim motions are the commands used to navigate your cursor from one place
of the file to another.
It is kind of a language in itself using which you can describe the edits
you want to make inside the current opened file.
It isn't bound only to the Vim editor but can be installed as an extension
on your preferred code editor.

## Modality of vim

Vim is a modal editor, that means there are different modes which can be used
to interact with the text in the editor.
There are 13 modes but most of the time you'll be using these 5 modes.

1. Normal Mode
2. Insert Mode
3. Visual Mode
4. Command Line Mode
5. Terminal Mode
